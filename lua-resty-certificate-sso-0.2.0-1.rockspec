  summary = "A library and recipe for enabling client certificate-based SSO using OpenResty",
  detailed = [[
    Makes it possible for an OpenResty install to use client certificates for auth.  Using
    this pattern, a single nginx virtual host will serve as an SSO endpoing.  Any other
    virtual hosts wishing to use the endpoint can simply include a snippet, which will
    handle redirection to the SSO endpoint.  A JWT token will be issued, which will be
    used for authentication.
